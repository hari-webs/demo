He also served as National Spokesperson of BJP and was vice-chairman of the Kerala wing of the BJP-led coalition National Democratic Alliance.\n\nFor causes he believes in and supports, Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar has apart from raising them in Parliament, actively approached the courts to intervene on behalf of citizens as in the case of Section 66A of the IT Act, securing voting rights for members of the Armed Forces among other issues. He is widely recognized as the most informed and active MP on Digital India, Internet and Technology issues, Spectrum Allocation, Net Neutrality, Consumer rights in cyber space policies and other regulatory matters.\n\nIt was his relentless campaign and later a petition in the Supreme Court that led to Armed Forces personnel getting the right to vote in their place of posting in the 2014 General Elections and further electoral reforms to bring the facility of e-Postal Ballot to Armed Forces. After the Uri Terror attack in September 2016, he was the first MP in India to have challenged the MFN status granted to Pakistan and submitted a Private Member's Bill in the Rajya Sabha on 18 November 2016 titled: \"The Declaration of Countries as Sponsor of Terrorism Bill, 2016\".\n\nIn February 2016, Rajeev was felicitated by the General Officer Commanding-in- Chief, Western Command, Lt Gen KJ Singh, PVSM, AVSM (Bar) with the GOC-in- C Commendation Card at HQ Western Command, Chandigarh for his support and work for the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families.\n\nAdditionally, he has focused on and taken up a wide array of macro-economic and micro-economic issues that include restructuring of Public Sector Banks, creating Transparency in the management of Public Assets and repairing key sectors in the economy to revive growth amongst others. Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar's insight made him one of the first individuals to raise concerns regarding the ad hoc allocation of 2G licenses starting 2007 - which led to cancellation of 122 licenses by the Supreme Court of India in 2012."

He also served as National Spokesperson of BJP and was vice-chairman of the Kerala wing of the BJP-led coalition National Democratic Alliance.\n\nFor causes he believes in and supports, Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar has apart from raising them in Parliament, actively approached the courts to intervene on behalf of citizens as in the case of Section 66A of the IT Act, securing voting rights for members of the Armed Forces among other issues. He is widely recognized as the most informed and active MP on Digital India, Internet and Technology issues, Spectrum Allocation, Net Neutrality, Consumer rights in cyber space policies and other regulatory matters.\n\nIt was his relentless campaign and later a petition in the Supreme Court that led to Armed Forces personnel getting the right to vote in their place of posting in the 2014 General Elections and further electoral reforms to bring the facility of e-Postal Ballot to Armed Forces. After the Uri Terror attack in September 2016, he was the first MP in India to have challenged the MFN status granted to Pakistan and submitted a Private Member's Bill in the Rajya Sabha on 18 November 2016 titled: \"The Declaration of Countries as Sponsor of Terrorism Bill, 2016\".\n\nIn February 2016, Rajeev was felicitated by the General Officer Commanding-in- Chief, Western Command, Lt Gen KJ Singh, PVSM, AVSM (Bar) with the GOC-in- C Commendation Card at HQ Western Command, Chandigarh for his support and work for the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families.\n\nAdditionally, he has focused on and taken up a wide array of macro-economic and micro-economic issues that include restructuring of Public Sector Banks, creating Transparency in the management of Public Assets and repairing key sectors in the economy to revive growth amongst others. Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar's insight made him one of the first individuals to raise concerns regarding the ad hoc allocation of 2G licenses starting 2007 - which led to cancellation of 122 licenses by the Supreme Court of India in 2012."

With innovative pedagogy and a supportive and creative environment, these so-called failures have excelled in their chosen fields and risen to international acclaim as entrepreneurs, film makers, politicians, teachers and so on. As a result of the reforms he introduced in the government school system in Ladakh, the pass percentage at 10th grade (matriculation) rose from a dismal 5% to 55% in seven years and 75% these days."

He has studied business administration and followed that up with a course in advertising & media planning from MICA. Formerly a Vice President at Ogilvy & Mather, Ameen has over 20 years of experience in advertising, marketing, consulting and theatre. His work is deeply influenced by his experiences in communications, both as a marketer and as an actor.

When not studying or teaching storytelling, he loves climbing hills and playing table tennis."

After experiencing the benefits, his company Vakil Housing became the first in India to get trained in GTD by the David Allen Company in 2008, and he became a GTD Trainer. Practicing GTD allowed Ali to channel his love for art and spirituality by creating Sufi Comics. He began drawing spiritual comics and overtime has published 3 books, all of which have been nominated for awards. He’s also founded the ILM Foundation with like minded friends, under which ILM Montessori is run. A school to nurture a generation of worthy successors of our generation. Having experienced the benefits of GTD, his latest venture Calm Achiever focuses on training senior executives and entrepreneurs in the Art of Stress-Free Productivity with GTD."
